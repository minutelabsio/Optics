Physics EduWidgets (Optics)
============================

This is the codebase for the [Corner Reflector EduWidget](http://wellcaffeinated.github.com/Optics/corner-reflector/), by [Jasper Palfree](http://wellcaffeinated.net) made to compliment the work of [Henry Reich (of MinutePhysics)](http://minutephysics.com) and [Destin (of Smarter Every Day)](http://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2).

Built using Yeoman.io for dependency management and Raphael.js for SVG rendering.
